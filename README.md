** Business Value **

Business value the Happy Plants application provides and what problem does it solve for our end users:

Happy Plants is an Android application that helps its users better care for plants alerting them on when to water their beloved plants. Plant owners, often times find themselves with dead, unhappy, and neglected plants because of a stressful and hectic work/life schedule. Happy Plants helps solve this problem by automatically calculating watering times and reminding owners  to water their plants via push notification, device alarm, and scheduling the task in their calendar. With the Happy Plants app, owning a plant just got a lot easier.
There are a few applications currently on the Play Store that are more complex and very niche-based, focusing on a specific group of people (avid gardeners) that does not apply to the wider demographic. There are also many applications that will only provide a reminder service to the user, in which the user has to input the frequency of the reminders themselves . Happy Plants will take a more user-friendly approach by providing a simpler UI and the ability for users to not have to look up care information for common house plants. Additionally, the Happy Plants app will automatically create reminders instead of the user inputting information.
We plan to start with basic functionality and add more features in future releases.
