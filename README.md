## Are you a fan of raising succulent plant?

## Have you ever wonder why the plant you raise always dead?

## Do you want to share your experience of raising a plant with your friend?

I want to develop an application that can help people who are interested in raising plants but have no time to take care of them. The app will:

1. Ask several questions to user to determine a plant they want to raise

2. Pull out specific plant raising related data from open source API and render on UI.

3. Set time clock to notice user to water the plant.

4. keep track of temperature if possible.

The app will also leverage android api such as,

1. Call camera to take picture.

2. Clock to track the time.

3. maybe monitoring the temperature and light intensity.

4. Link with instagram, facebook or twitter.

5. Auto generate timeline of your raising history.

Good news! I looked on the Apple app store, and I don't see an app of this kind published. I don't own an android device. But, I checked Google Play Store, and I found the Plant Nanny, but it actually isn't what you think, the app helps YOU drink more water. :)

I checked the other apps and nothing stands out.

Harry, would be great if we can tap into a plant API, to some how calculate watering, info. I found this plant image dataset: https://www.plant-image-analysis.org/dataset

And, this API from the US Department of Agriculture that we can tap into. :)

For push notification, Harry, we can maybe look at third-party push provider OneSignal. It's free. https://onesignal.com/
